# TM Warthog config script for StarCitizen v3.5.0

A simple Warthog HOTAS setup to match the current SC control schema.
The goal is to use as much of the SC default keybindings to minimize the controllers setup ordeal between releases.

## How to run
 * check out or download the files under ```./script```. All of it.
 * point your T.A.R.G.E.T. software to run the script directly w/o loading the GUI ```"C:\Program Files (x86)\Thrustmaster\TARGET\x64\TARGETGUI.exe" -r "E:\StarCitizen-WarthogScript\script\StarCitizen_3.5.x_combined.tmc"```
 * check out or download the keybindings file under ```sc-settings/mappings```
 * in-game import the keybindings.
    * Keyboard -> Keyboard
    * Mouse -> Mouse
    * Joystick (1) -> Joystick (1) // virtual Warthog
    * Joystick (2) -> Joystick (2) // Rudder Pedals
