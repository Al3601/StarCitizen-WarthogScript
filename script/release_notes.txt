current master (WIP)
v0.2.4
Tested with SC 3.8.0
- Added support for 3.8.x
- Removed a key binding for an emote which I had in my custom key bindings XML because it is shadowing melee mode toggle key "0" introduced with 3.8.0.

v0.2.3
Tested with SC 3.7.1
- fixed joystick acceleration limiter axis from reversed to normal

v0.2.2
Tested with SC 3.7.1
- fixed joystick assignment (now there's only 2 not 3)

v0.2.1
Tested with SC 3.7.0
- Added support for StarCitizen 3.7.x
- Bound EFRNORM to hail the targeted ship
- Bound EACON/EACOFF to VTOL switch
- Inverted the Acceleration limiter axis to be 0 and 100% at their natural positions.
- Fixed the laser throttle direction in mining mode.
- Added distinct key bindings to open/close lock/unlock exteriors. 
- updated layout schematics

v0.2.0
Tested with SC 3.6.0
- Added support for Star Citizen 3.6.x
- Rebound former speed limiter Z-Axis-Rotation to Acceleration Limiter
- Bound speed limiter to slider 2
- Bound acceleration limiter to left throttle. I bound it intentionally in inversed order
  so that it is possible to adjust vertical thrust in hover mode similar to a helicopter (pulling up increases thrust).
- Bound space brake to right throttle IDLE position
- Removed TrackIR mode on/of switch from FLOW_R since it is not necessary anymore with native TrackIR support in SC.
Caveats:
- Yet untested mining mode
- Freelook is no toggle anymore

v0.1.6
- Removed permanent F4 keypress from camera switch. It happened to me that I killed the game by accidently hitting the "Alt" key which added up to Alt+F4. ... m(
- adde keybindings to lock/unlock the ship, open/close exterior and changed some emotes.

v0.1.5
Tested with SC 3.5.0.v
- Added switch (EACON) to toggle into camera mode and virtually hold the F4 key down
- Corrected the throttle axis behaviour. Now there's no confusion of the thrust inversion anymore.
- Added strafe forward/backward to MSR/MSL.
- Removed default mouse zoom from mouse wheel in interactive mode and replaced it by MB4 + MB5 (mouse thumb buttons).
